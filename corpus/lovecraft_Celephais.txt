Beyond the Wall of Sleep 

 -PRON- have often wonder if the majority of mankind ever pause to reflect upon the 
 occasionally titanic significance of dream , and of the obscure world to which 
 -PRON- belong . whilst the great number of -PRON- nocturnal vision be perhaps no 
 more than faint and fantastic reflection of -PRON- wake experience - freud to the 
 contrary with -PRON- puerile symbolism - there be still a certain remainder whose 
 immundane and ethereal character permit of no ordinary interpretation , and 
 whose vaguely exciting and disquieting effect suggest possible minute glimpse 
 into a sphere of mental existence no less important than physical life , yet 
 separate from that life by an all but impassable barrier . from -PRON- experience -PRON- 
 can not doubt but that man , when lose to terrestrial consciousness , be indeed 
 sojourning in another and uncorporeal life of far different nature from the life -PRON- 
 know , and of which only the slight and most indistinct memory linger after 
 wake . from those blur and fragmentary memory -PRON- may infer much , yet 
 prove little . -PRON- may guess that in dreams life , matter , and vitality , as the earth 
 know such thing , be not necessarily constant ; and that time and space do not 
 exist as -PRON- waking self comprehend -PRON- . sometimes -PRON- believe that this less 
 material life be -PRON- true life , and that -PRON- vain presence on the terraqueous globe 
 be -PRON- the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon . 

 -PRON- be from a youthful revery fill with speculation of this sort that -PRON- arise one 
 afternoon in the winter of 1900 - 01 , when to the state psychopathic institution in 
 which -PRON- serve as an intern be bring the man whose case have ever since 
 haunt -PRON- so unceasingly . -PRON- name , as give on the record , be Joe Slater , or 
 Slaader , and -PRON- appearance be that of the typical denizen of the Catskill 
 Mountain region ; one of those strange , repellent scion of a primitive Colonial 
 peasant stock whose isolation for nearly three century in the hilly fastness of 
 a little - travel countryside have cause -PRON- to sink to a kind of barbaric 
 degeneracy , rather than advance with -PRON- more fortunately place brother of 
 the thickly settle district . among these odd folk , who correspond exactly to the 
 decadent element of " white trash " in the South , law and moral be non - existent ; 
 and -PRON- general mental status be probably below that of any other section of 
 native american people . 

 Joe Slater , who come to the institution in the vigilant custody of four state 
 policeman , and who be describe as a highly dangerous character , certainly 
 present no evidence of -PRON- perilous disposition when -PRON- first beheld -PRON- .

 though well above the middle stature , and of somewhat brawny frame , -PRON- be 
 give an absurd appearance of harmless stupidity by the pale , sleepy blueness of 
 -PRON- small watery eye , the scantiness of -PRON- neglect and never - shave growth 
 of yellow beard , and the listless drooping of -PRON- heavy nether lip . -PRON- age be 
 unknown , since among -PRON- kind neither family record nor permanent family tie 
 exist ; but from the baldness of -PRON- head in front , and from the decayed condition 
 of -PRON- tooth , the head surgeon write -PRON- down as a man of about forty . 

 from the medical and court document -PRON- learn all that could be gather of 
 -PRON- case : this man , a vagabond , hunter and trapper , have always be strange in 
 the eye of -PRON- primitive associate . -PRON- have habitually sleep at night beyond the 
 ordinary time , and upon wake would often talk of unknown thing in a 
 manner so bizarre as to inspire fear even in the heart of an unimaginative 
 populace . not that -PRON- form of language be at all unusual , for -PRON- never speak 
 save in the debased patois of -PRON- environment ; but the tone and tenor of -PRON- 
 utterance be of such mysterious wildness , that none may listen without 
 apprehension . -PRON- -PRON- be generally as terrify and baffle as -PRON- auditor , 
 and within an hour after awakening would forget all that -PRON- have say , or at least 
 all that have cause -PRON- to say what -PRON- do ; relapse into a bovine , half - amiable 
 normality like that of the other hilldweller . 

 as Slater grow old , -PRON- appear , -PRON- matutinal aberration have gradually 
 increase in frequency and violence ; till about a month before -PRON- arrival at the 
 institution have occur the shocking tragedy which cause -PRON- arrest by the 
 authority . one day near noon , after a profound sleep begin in a whiskey 
 debauch at about five of the previous afternoon , the man have rouse -PRON- 
 most suddenly , with ululation so horrible and unearthly that -PRON- bring 
 several neighbor to -PRON- cabin - a filthy sty where -PRON- dwell with a family as 
 indescribable as -PRON- . rush out into the snow , -PRON- have fling -PRON- arm aloft 
 and commence a series of leap directly upward in the air ; the while shout 
 -PRON- determination to reach some " big , big cabin with brightness in the roof and 
 wall and floor and the loud queer music far away " . as two man of moderate 
 size seek to restrain -PRON- , -PRON- have struggle with maniacal force and fury , 
 scream of -PRON- desire and need to find and kill a certain " thing that shine and 
 shake and laughs " . at length , after temporarily fell one of -PRON- detainer with 
 a sudden blow , -PRON- have fling -PRON- upon the other in a demoniac ecstasy of 
 blood - thirstiness , shriek fiendishly that -PRON- would " jump high in the air and 
 burn -PRON- way through anything that stop -PRON- " . 

 family and neighbor have now flee in a panic , and when the more courageous of 
 -PRON- return . Slater be go , leave behind an unrecognizable pulp - like 
 thing that have be a live man but an hour before . none of the mountaineer 
 have dare to pursue -PRON- , and -PRON- be likely that -PRON- would have welcome -PRON- 



 94 



 death from the cold ; but when several morning later -PRON- hear -PRON- scream 
 from a distant ravine -PRON- realize that -PRON- have somehow manage to survive , 
 and that -PRON- removal in one way or another would be necessary . then have 
 follow an armed searching - party , whose purpose ( whatever -PRON- may have be 
 originally ) become that of a sheriff 's posse after one of the seldom popular state 
 trooper have by accident observe , then question , and finally join the 
 seeker . 

 on the third day Slater be find unconscious in the hollow of a tree , and take 
 to the near jail , where alienist from Albany examine -PRON- as soon as -PRON- 
 sense return . to -PRON- -PRON- tell a simple story . -PRON- have , -PRON- say , go to sleep 
 one afternoon about sundown after drink much liquor . -PRON- have awaken to 
 find -PRON- stand bloody - handed in the snow before -PRON- cabin , the mangle 
 corpse of -PRON- neighbor Peter Slader at -PRON- foot . horrified , -PRON- have take to the 
 wood in a vague effort to escape from the scene of what must have be -PRON- 
 crime . beyond these thing -PRON- seem to know nothing , nor could the expert 
 question of -PRON- interrogator bring out a single additional fact . 

 that night Slater sleep quietly , and the next morning -PRON- awaken with no 
 singular feature save a certain alteration of expression . Doctor Barnard , who have 
 be watch the patient , think -PRON- notice in the pale blue eye a certain 
 gleam of peculiar quality , and in the flaccid lip an all but imperceptible 
 tightening , as if of intelligent determination . but when question . Slater 
 relapse into the habitual vacancy of the mountaineer , and only reiterate what 
 -PRON- have say on the precede day . 

 on the third morning occur the first of the man 's mental attack . after some 
 show of uneasiness in sleep , -PRON- burst forth into a frenzy so powerful that the 
 combine effort of four man be need to bind -PRON- in a straightjacket . the 
 alienist listen with keen attention to -PRON- word , since -PRON- curiosity have be 
 arouse to a high pitch by the suggestive yet mostly conflict and incoherent 
 story of -PRON- family and neighbor . Slater rave for upward of fifteen minute , 
 babble in -PRON- backwood dialect of green edifice of light , ocean of space , 
 strange music , and shadowy mountain and valley . but most of all do -PRON- dwell 
 upon some mysterious blazing entity that shake and laugh and mock at 
 -PRON- . this vast , vague personality seem to have do -PRON- a terrible wrong , and 
 to kill -PRON- in triumphant revenge be -PRON- paramount desire . in order to reach -PRON- , -PRON- 
 say , -PRON- would soar through abyss of emptiness , burn every obstacle that 
 stand in -PRON- way . thus run -PRON- discourse , until with the great suddenness -PRON- 
 cease . the fire of madness die from -PRON- eye , and in dull wonder -PRON- look at 
 -PRON- questioner and ask why -PRON- be bind . Dr. Barnard unbuckle the leather 
 harness and do not restore -PRON- till night , when -PRON- succeed in persuade Slater 



 95 



 to don -PRON- of -PRON- own volition , for -PRON- own good . the man have now admit that 
 -PRON- sometimes talk queerly , though -PRON- know not why . 

 within a week two more attack appear , but from -PRON- the doctor learn 
 little . on the source of Slater 's vision -PRON- speculate at length , for since -PRON- 
 could neither read nor write , and have apparently never hear a legend or fairy- 
 tale , -PRON- gorgeous imagery be quite inexplicable . that -PRON- could not come from 
 any know myth or romance be make especially clear by the fact that the 
 unfortunate lunatic express -PRON- only in -PRON- own simple manner . -PRON- rave 
 of thing -PRON- do not understand and could not interpret ; thing which -PRON- claim 
 to have experience , but which -PRON- could not have learn through any normal or 
 connect narration . the alienist soon agree that abnormal dream be the 
 foundation of the trouble ; dream whose vividness could for a time completely 
 dominate the wake mind of this basically inferior man . with due formality 
 Slater be try for murder , acquit on the ground of insanity , and commit 
 to the institution wherein -PRON- hold so humble a post . 

 -PRON- have say that -PRON- be a constant speculator concern dream - life , and from this 
 -PRON- may judge of the eagerness with which -PRON- apply -PRON- to the study of the 
 new patient as soon as -PRON- have fully ascertain the fact of -PRON- case . -PRON- seem to 
 sense a certain friendliness in -PRON- , bear no doubt of the interest -PRON- could not 
 conceal , and the gentle manner in which -PRON- question -PRON- . not that -PRON- ever 
 recognize -PRON- during -PRON- attack , when -PRON- hang breathlessly upon -PRON- chaotic but 
 cosmic word - picture ; but -PRON- know -PRON- in -PRON- quiet hour , when -PRON- would sit by 
 -PRON- bar window weaving basket of straw and willow , and perhaps pine for 
 the mountain freedom -PRON- could never again enjoy . -PRON- family never call to see 
 -PRON- ; probably -PRON- have find another temporary head , after the manner of 
 decadent mountain folk . 

 by degree -PRON- commence to feel an overwhelming wonder at the mad and 
 fantastic conception of Joe Slater . the man -PRON- be pitiably inferior in 
 mentality and language alike ; but -PRON- glowing , titanic vision , though describe 
 in a barbarous disjoint jargon , be assuredly thing which only a superior or 
 even exceptional brain could conceive how , -PRON- often ask -PRON- , could the 
 stolid imagination of a Catskill degenerate conjure up sight whose very 
 possession argue a lurk spark of genius ? how could any backwood dullard 
 have gain so much as an idea of those glitter realm of supernal radiance 
 and space about which Slater rant in -PRON- furious delirium ? More and more -PRON- 
 inclined to the belief that in the pitiful personality who cringe before -PRON- lie the 
 disorder nucleus of something beyond -PRON- comprehension ; something 
 infinitely beyond the comprehension of -PRON- more experienced but less 
 imaginative medical and scientific colleague . 



 96 



 and yet -PRON- could extract nothing definite from the man . the sum of all -PRON- 
 investigation be , that in a kind of semi - corporeal dream - life Slater wander or 
 float through resplendent and prodigious valley , meadow , garden , city , 
 and palace of light , in a region unbounded and unknown to man ; that there -PRON- 
 be no peasant or degenerate , but a creature of importance and vivid life , 
 move proudly and dominantly , and check only by a certain deadly enemy , 
 who seem to be a being of visible yet ethereal structure , and who do not 
 appear to be of human shape , since Slater never refer to -PRON- as a man , or as 
 aught save a thing . this thing have do Slater some hideous but unnamed 
 wrong , which the maniac ( if maniac -PRON- be ) yearn to avenge . 

 from the manner in which Slater allude to -PRON- dealing , -PRON- judge that -PRON- and 
 the luminous thing have meet on equal term ; that in -PRON- dream existence the man 
 be -PRON- a luminous thing of the same race as -PRON- enemy . this impression 
 be sustain by -PRON- frequent reference to fly through space and burn all 
 that impede -PRON- progress . yet these conception be formulate in rustic 
 word wholly inadequate to convey -PRON- , a circumstance which drive -PRON- to the 
 conclusion that if a dream world indeed exist , oral language be not -PRON- 
 medium for the transmission of thought . Could -PRON- be that the dream soul 
 inhabit this inferior body be desperately struggle to speak thing which 
 the simple and halting tongue of dullness could not utter ? Could -PRON- be that -PRON- be 
 face to face with intellectual emanation which would explain the mystery if -PRON- 
 could but learn to discover and read -PRON- ? -PRON- do not tell the old physician of 
 these thing , for middle age be skeptical , cynical , and disincline to accept new 
 idea . besides , the head of the institution have but lately warn -PRON- in -PRON- 
 paternal way that -PRON- be overwork ; that -PRON- mind need a rest . 

 -PRON- have long be -PRON- belief that human thought consist basically of atomic or 
 molecular motion , convertible into ether wave or radiant energy like heat , light 
 and electricity . this belief have early lead -PRON- to contemplate the possibility of 
 telepathy or mental communication by mean of suitable apparatus , and -PRON- have in 
 -PRON- college day prepare a set of transmit and receive instrument 
 somewhat similar to the cumbrous device employ in wireless telegraphy at 
 that crude , pre - radio period . these -PRON- have test with a fellow - student , but 
 achieve no result , have soon pack -PRON- away with other scientific odd and 
 end for possible future use . 

 now , in -PRON- intense desire to probe into the dream - life of Joe Slater , -PRON- seek 
 these instrument again , and spend several day in repair -PRON- for action . 
 when -PRON- be complete once more -PRON- miss no opportunity for -PRON- trial . at 
 each outburst of Slater 's violence , -PRON- would fit the transmitter to -PRON- forehead and 
 the receiver to -PRON- own , constantly make delicate adjustment for various 
 hypothetical wave- length of intellectual energy . -PRON- have but little notion of how 



 97 



 the thought - impression would , if successfully convey , arouse an intelligent 
 response in -PRON- brain , but -PRON- feel certain that -PRON- could detect and interpret -PRON- . 
 accordingly -PRON- continue -PRON- experiment , though inform no one of -PRON- 
 nature . 

 -PRON- be on the twenty - first of February , 1901 , that the thing occur . as -PRON- look 
 back across the year -PRON- realize how unreal -PRON- seem , and sometimes wonder if old 
 Doctor Fenton be not right when -PRON- charge -PRON- all to -PRON- excited imagination . -PRON- 
 recall that -PRON- listen with great kindness and patience when -PRON- tell -PRON- , but 
 afterward give -PRON- a nerve - powder and arrange for the half - year 's vacation on 
 which -PRON- depart the next week . 

 that fateful night -PRON- be wildly agitate and perturb , for despite the excellent 
 care -PRON- have receive , Joe Slater be unmistakably die . perhaps -PRON- be -PRON- 
 mountain freedom that -PRON- miss , or perhaps the turmoil in -PRON- brain have grow 
 too acute for -PRON- rather sluggish physique ; but at all event the flame of vitality 
 flicker low in the decadent body . -PRON- be drowsy near the end , and as 
 darkness fall -PRON- drop off into a troubled sleep . 

 -PRON- do not strap on the straightjacket as be customary when -PRON- sleep , since -PRON- see 
 that -PRON- be too feeble to be dangerous , even if -PRON- wake in mental disorder once 
 more before pass away . but -PRON- do place upon -PRON- head and -PRON- the two end 
 of -PRON- cosmic " radio " , hope against hope for a first and last message from the 
 dream world in the brief time remain . in the cell with -PRON- be one nurse , a 
 mediocre fellow who do not understand the purpose of the apparatus , or think 
 to inquire into -PRON- course . as the hour wear on -PRON- see -PRON- head droop 
 awkwardly in sleep , but -PRON- do not disturb -PRON- . -PRON- -PRON- , lull by the rhythmical 
 breathing of the healthy and the die man , must have nod a little later . 

 the sound of weird lyric melody be what arouse -PRON- . chord , vibration , and 
 harmonic ecstasy echo passionately on every hand , while on -PRON- ravish 
 sight burst the stupendous spectacle ultimate beauty . wall , column , and 
 architrave of live fire blaze effulgently around the spot where -PRON- seem to 
 float in air , extend upward to an infinitely high vaulted dome of indescribable 
 splendor . blend with this display of palatial magnificence , or rather , 
 supplant -PRON- at time in kaleidoscopic rotation , be glimpse of wide plain 
 and graceful valley , high mountain and invite grotto , cover with every 
 lovely attribute of scenery which -PRON- delighted eye could conceive of , yet 
 form wholly of some glowing , ethereal plastic entity , which in consistency 
 partake as much of spirit as of matter . as -PRON- gaze , -PRON- perceive that -PRON- own brain 
 hold the key to these enchanting metamorphosis ; for each vista which appear 
 to -PRON- be the one -PRON- change mind most wish to behold . amidst this 
 elysian realm -PRON- dwelt not as a stranger , for each sight and sound be familiar to 



 98 



 -PRON- ; just as -PRON- have be for uncounted eon of eternity before , and would be for 
 like eternity to come . 

 then the resplendent aura of -PRON- brother of light draw near and hold colloquy 
 with -PRON- , soul to soul , with silent and perfect interchange of thought . the hour 
 be one of approach triumph , for be not -PRON- fellow - being escape at last 
 from a degrade periodic bondage ; escape forever , and prepare to follow 
 the accurse oppressor even unto the uttermost field of ether , that upon -PRON- may 
 be work a flaming cosmic vengeance which would shake the sphere ? -PRON- 
 float thus for a little time , when -PRON- perceive a slight blurring and fading of the 
 object around -PRON- , as though some force be recall -PRON- to earth - where -PRON- least 
 wish to go . the form near -PRON- seem to feel a change also , for -PRON- gradually 
 bring -PRON- discourse toward a conclusion , and -PRON- prepare to quit the scene , 
 fade from -PRON- sight at a rate somewhat less rapid than that of the other object . 
 a few more thought be exchange , and -PRON- know that the luminous one and -PRON- 
 be be recall to bondage , though for -PRON- brother of light -PRON- would be the 
 last time . the sorry planet shell be well - nigh spend , in less than an hour -PRON- 
 fellow would be free to pursue the oppressor along the Milky Way and past the 
 hither star to the very confine of infinity . 

 a well - define shock separate -PRON- final impression of the fading scene of light 
 from -PRON- sudden and somewhat shameface awaken and straighten up in 
 -PRON- chair as -PRON- see the die figure on the couch move hesitantly . Joe Slater be 
 indeed awake , though probably for the last time . as -PRON- look more closely , -PRON- 
 see that in the sallow cheek shine spot of color which have never before be 
 present . the lip , too , seem unusual , be tightly compress , as if by the 
 force of a strong character than have be Slater 's . the whole face finally begin 
 to grow tense , and the head turn restlessly with close eye . 

 -PRON- do not rouse the sleep nurse , but readjust the slightly disarranged 
 headband of -PRON- telepathic " radio " , intent to catch any parting message the 
 dreamer may have to deliver . all at once the head turn sharply in -PRON- 
 direction and the eye fall open , cause -PRON- to stare in blank amazement at what 
 -PRON- beheld . the man who have be Joe Slater , the Catskill decadent , be gaze at 
 -PRON- with a pair of luminous , expand eye whose blue seem subtly to have 
 deepen . neither mania nor degeneracy be visible in that gaze , and -PRON- feel 
 beyond a doubt that -PRON- be view a face behind which lie an active mind of 
 high order . 

 at this juncture -PRON- brain become aware of a steady external influence operate 
 upon -PRON- . -PRON- close -PRON- eye to concentrate -PRON- thought more profoundly and be 
 reward by the positive knowledge that -PRON- long - seek mental message have 
 come at last . each transmit idea form rapidly in -PRON- mind , and though no 



 99 



 actual language be employ , -PRON- habitual association of conception and 
 expression be so great that -PRON- seem to be receive the message in ordinary 
 English . 

 " Joe Slater be dead/ ' come the soul - petrify voice of an agency from beyond the 
 wall of sleep . -PRON- open eye seek the couch of pain in curious horror , but the 
 blue eye be still calmly gaze , and the countenance be still intelligently 
 animate . " -PRON- be better dead , for -PRON- be unfit to bear the active intellect of 
 cosmic entity . -PRON- gross body could not undergo the need adjustment 
 between ethereal life and planet life . -PRON- be too much an animal , too little a 
 man ; yet -PRON- be through -PRON- deficiency that -PRON- have come to discover -PRON- , for the 
 cosmic and planet soul rightly should never meet . -PRON- have be in -PRON- torment 
 and diurnal prison for forty - two of -PRON- terrestrial year . 

 " -PRON- be an entity like that which -PRON- -PRON- become in the freedom of dreamless 
 sleep . -PRON- be -PRON- brother of light , and have float with -PRON- in the effulgent 
 valley . -PRON- be not permit -PRON- to tell -PRON- wake earth - self of -PRON- real self , but 
 -PRON- be all roamer of vast space and traveler in many age . next year -PRON- may be 
 dwell in the Egypt which -PRON- call ancient , or in the cruel empire of Tsan Chan 
 which be to come three thousand year hence . -PRON- and -PRON- have drift to the 
 world that reel about the red Arcturus , and dwelt in the body of the insect- 
 philosopher that crawl proudly over the fourth moon of Jupiter . how little do 
 the earth self know life and -PRON- extent ! how little , indeed , ought -PRON- to know for -PRON- 
 own tranquility ! 

 " of the oppressor -PRON- can not speak . -PRON- on earth have unwittingly feel -PRON- distant 
 presence - -PRON- who without know idly give the blink beacon the name of 
 Algol , the Demon - Star . -PRON- be to meet and conquer the oppressor that -PRON- have vainly 
 strive for eon , hold back by bodily encumbrance . tonight -PRON- go as a Nemesis 
 bear just and blazingly cataclysmic vengeance . watch -PRON- in the sky close by 
 the Demon - Star . 

 " -PRON- can not speak longer , for the body of Joe Slater grow cold and rigid , and the 
 coarse brain be cease to vibrate as -PRON- wish . -PRON- have be -PRON- only friend on 
 this planet - the only soul to sense and seek for -PRON- within the repellent form 
 which lie on this couch . -PRON- shall meet again - perhaps in the shine mist of 
 Orion 's Sword , perhaps on a bleak plateau in prehistoric Asia , perhaps in 
 unremembered dream tonight , perhaps in some other form an eon hence , when 
 the solar system shall have be sweep away . " 

 at this point the thought - wave abruptly cease , the pale eye of the dreamer - 
 or can -PRON- say dead man ? - commence to glaze fishily . in a half - stupor -PRON- cross 
 over to the couch and feel of -PRON- wrist , but find -PRON- cold , stiff , and pulseless . the 



 100 



 sallow cheek pale again , and the thick lip fall open , disclose the repulsively 
 rotten fang of the degenerate Joe Slater . -PRON- shiver , pull a blanket over the 
 hideous face , and awaken the nurse . then -PRON- leave the cell and go silently to 
 -PRON- room . -PRON- have an instant and unaccountable craving for a sleep whose dream -PRON- 
 should not remember . 

 the climax ? what plain tale of science can boast of such a rhetorical effect ? -PRON- have 
 merely set down certain thing appeal to -PRON- as fact , allow -PRON- to 
 construe -PRON- as -PRON- will . as -PRON- have already admit , -PRON- superior , old Doctor 
 Fenton , deny the reality of everything -PRON- have relate . -PRON- vow that -PRON- be 
 break down with nervous strain , and badly in need of a long vacation on full 
 pay which -PRON- so generously give -PRON- . -PRON- assure -PRON- on -PRON- professional honor 
 that Joe Slater be but a low - grade paranoiac , whose fantastic notion must have 
 come from the crude hereditary folk - tale which circulate in even the most 
 decadent of community . all this -PRON- tell -PRON- - yet -PRON- can not forget what -PRON- see in 
 the sky on the night after Slater die . lest -PRON- think -PRON- a biased witness , another 
 pen must add this final testimony , which may perhaps supply the climax -PRON- 
 expect . -PRON- will quote the follow account of the star Nova Persei verbatim from 
 the page of that eminent astronomical authority . Professor Garrett P. Serviss : 

 " on February 22 , 1901 , a marvelous new star be discover by Doctor 
 Anderson of Edinburgh , not very far from Algol . no star have be visible at that 
 point before . within twenty - four hour the stranger have become so bright that -PRON- 
 outshone Capella . in a week or two -PRON- have visibly fade , and in the course of a 
 few month -PRON- be hardly discernible with the naked eye
