 -PRON- be the immensity , -PRON- believe . the hugeness of thing below . the darkness of dream . but -PRON- be woolgather . forgive -PRON- . -PRON- be not a literary man . 
 -PRON- have be in need of lodging . that be how -PRON- meet -PRON- . -PRON- want someone to share the cost of room with -PRON- . -PRON- be introduce by a mutual acquaintance , in the chemical laboratory of St. Bart ’s . " -PRON- have be in Afghanistan , -PRON- perceive , " that be what -PRON- say to -PRON- , and -PRON- mouth fall open and -PRON- eye open very wide . 
 " Astonishing , " -PRON- say . 
 " not really , " say the stranger in the white lab - coat , who be to become -PRON- friend . " from the way -PRON- hold -PRON- arm , -PRON- see -PRON- have be wound , and in a particular way . -PRON- have a deep tan . -PRON- also have a military bearing , and there be few enough place in the Empire that a military man can be both tan and , give the nature of the injury to -PRON- shoulder and the tradition of the afghan cave - folk , torture . " 
 put like that , of course , -PRON- be absurdly simple . but then , -PRON- always be . -PRON- have be tan nut - brown . and -PRON- have indeed , as -PRON- have observe , be torture . 
 the god and man of Afghanistan be savage , unwilling to be rule from Whitehall or from Berlin or even from Moscow , and unprepared to see reason . -PRON- have be send into those hill , attach to the —— th Regiment . as long as the fighting remain in the hill and mountain , -PRON- fight on an equal footing . when the skirmish descend into the cave and the darkness then -PRON- find -PRON- , as -PRON- be , out of -PRON- depth and in over -PRON- head . 
 -PRON- shall not forget the mirrored surface of the underground lake , nor the thing that emerge from the lake , -PRON- eye open and closing , and the singing whisper that accompany -PRON- as -PRON- rise , wreathe -PRON- way about -PRON- like the buzzing of fly big than world . 
 that -PRON- survive be a miracle , but survive -PRON- do , and -PRON- return to England with -PRON- nerve in shred and tatter . the place that leech - like mouth have touch -PRON- be tattoo forever , frog - white , into the skin of -PRON- now - wither shoulder . -PRON- have once be a crack - shot . now -PRON- have nothing , save a fear of the 
 world - beneath - the - world akin to panic , which mean that -PRON- would gladly pay sixpence of -PRON- army pension for a Hansom cab rather than a penny to travel underground . 
 still , the fog and darkness of London comfort -PRON- , take -PRON- in . -PRON- have lose -PRON- first lodging because -PRON- scream in the night . -PRON- have be in Afghanistan ; -PRON- be there no longer . 
 " -PRON- scream in the night , " -PRON- tell -PRON- . 
 " -PRON- have be tell that -PRON- snore , " -PRON- say . " also -PRON- keep irregular hour , and -PRON- often use the mantelpiece for target practice . -PRON- will need the sit room to meet client . -PRON- be selfish , private , and easily bored . Will this be a problem ? " 
 -PRON- smile , and -PRON- shake -PRON- head , and extend -PRON- hand . -PRON- shake on -PRON- . 
 the room -PRON- have find for -PRON- , in Baker Street , be more than adequate for two bachelor . -PRON- bear in mind all -PRON- friend have say about -PRON- desire for privacy , and -PRON- forbore from ask what -PRON- be -PRON- do for a living . still , there be much to pique -PRON- curiosity . visitor would arrive at all hour , and when -PRON- do -PRON- would leave the sitting room and repair to -PRON- bedroom , ponder what -PRON- could have in common with -PRON- friend : the pale woman with one eye bone - white , the small man who look like a commercial traveler , the portly dandy in -PRON- velvet jacket , and the rest . some be frequent visitor , many other come only once , speak to -PRON- , and leave , look troubled or look satisfied . 
 -PRON- be a mystery to -PRON- . 
 -PRON- be partake of one of -PRON- landlady ’s magnificent breakfast one morning , when -PRON- friend ring the bell to summon that good lady . " there will be a gentleman join -PRON- , in about four minute , " -PRON- say . " -PRON- will need another place at table . " 
 " very good , " -PRON- say , " -PRON- will put more sausage under the grill . " 
 -PRON- friend return to peruse -PRON- morning paper . -PRON- wait for an explanation with grow impatience . finally , -PRON- could stand -PRON- no longer . " -PRON- do not understand . how could -PRON- know that in four minute -PRON- would be receive a visitor ? there be no telegram , no message of any kind . " 
 -PRON- smile , thinly . " -PRON- do not hear the clatter of a brougham several minute ago ? -PRON- slow as -PRON- pass -PRON- — obviously as the driver identify -PRON- door , then -PRON- speed up and go past , up into the Marylebone Road . there be a crush of carriage and taxicabs let off passenger at the railway station and at the waxwork , and -PRON- be in that crush that anyone wish to alight without be observe will go . the walk from there to here be but four minute … . " 
 -PRON- glance at -PRON- pocket watch , and as -PRON- do so -PRON- hear a tread on the stair outside . 
 " come in , Lestrade , " -PRON- call . " the door be ajar , and -PRON- sausage be just come out from under the grill . " 
 a man -PRON- take to be Lestrade open the door , then close -PRON- carefully behind -PRON- . " -PRON- should not , " -PRON- say . " but truth to tell , -PRON- have not have a chance to break -PRON- fast this morning . and -PRON- could certainly do justice to a few of those sausage . " -PRON- be the small man -PRON- have observe on several occasion previously , whose demeanor be that of a traveler in rubber novelty or patent nostrum . 
 -PRON- friend wait until -PRON- landlady have leave the room before -PRON- say , " obviously , -PRON- take -PRON- this be a matter of national importance . " 
 " -PRON- star , " say Lestrade , and -PRON- pale . " surely the word can not be out already . tell -PRON- -PRON- be not . " -PRON- begin to pile -PRON- plate high with sausage , kipper fillets , kedgeree , and toast , but -PRON- hand shake , a little . 
 " of course not , " say -PRON- friend . " -PRON- know the squeak of -PRON- brougham wheel , though , after all this time : 
 an oscillating g sharp above high C. and if Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard can not publicly be see to come into the parlor of London ’s only consulting detective , yet come anyway , and without have have -PRON- breakfast , then -PRON- know that this be not a routine case . Ergo , -PRON- involve those above -PRON- and be a matter of national importance . " 
 lestrade dabbed egg yolk from -PRON- chin with -PRON- napkin . -PRON- stare at -PRON- . -PRON- do not look like -PRON- idea of a police inspector , but then , -PRON- friend look little enough like -PRON- idea of a consulting detective — whatever that may be . 
 " perhaps -PRON- should discuss the matter privately , " Lestrade say , glance at -PRON- . 
 -PRON- friend begin to smile , impishly , and -PRON- head move on -PRON- shoulder as -PRON- do when -PRON- be enjoy a private joke . " nonsense , " -PRON- say . " two head be well than one . and what be say to one of -PRON- be say to -PRON- both . " 
 " if -PRON- be intrude — " -PRON- say , gruffly , but -PRON- motion -PRON- to silence . 
 Lestrade shrug . " -PRON- ’ all the same to -PRON- , " -PRON- say , after a moment . " if -PRON- solve the case then -PRON- have -PRON- job . if -PRON- do not , then -PRON- have no job . -PRON- use -PRON- method , that ’ what -PRON- say . -PRON- can not make thing any bad . " 
 " if there ’ one thing that a study of history have teach -PRON- , -PRON- be that thing can always get bad , " say -PRON- friend . " when do -PRON- go to Shoreditch ? " 
 Lestrade drop -PRON- fork . " this be too bad ! " -PRON- exclaim . " here -PRON- be , make sport of -PRON- , when -PRON- know all about the matter ! -PRON- should be ashamed — " 
 " no one have tell -PRON- anything of the matter . when a police inspector walk into -PRON- room with fresh splash of mud of that peculiar mustard - yellow hue on -PRON- boot and trouser leg , -PRON- can surely be forgive for presume that -PRON- have recently walk past the digging at Hobbs Lane , in Shoreditch , which be the only place in London that particular mustard - color clay seem to be find . " 
 Inspector Lestrade look embarrassed . " now -PRON- put -PRON- like that , " -PRON- say , " -PRON- seem so obvious . " -PRON- friend push -PRON- plate away from -PRON- . " of course -PRON- do , " -PRON- say , slightly testily . 
 -PRON- ride to the East End in a cab . Inspector Lestrade have walk up to the Marylebone Road to find -PRON- brougham , and leave -PRON- alone . 
 " so -PRON- be truly a consulting detective ? " -PRON- say . 
 " the only one in London , or perhaps , the world , " say -PRON- friend . " -PRON- do not take case . instead , -PRON- consult . other bring -PRON- -PRON- insoluble problem , -PRON- describe -PRON- , and , sometimes , -PRON- solve -PRON- . " 
 " then those people who come to -PRON- — " 
 " be , in the main , police officer , or be detective -PRON- , yes . " 
 -PRON- be a fine morning , but -PRON- be now jolt about the edge of the rookery of St. Giles , that warren of thief and cutthroat which sit on London like a cancer on the face of a pretty flower - seller , and the only light to enter the cab be dim and faint . 
 " be -PRON- sure that -PRON- wish -PRON- along with -PRON- ? " 
 in reply -PRON- friend stare at -PRON- without blink . " -PRON- have a feeling , " -PRON- say . " -PRON- have a feeling that -PRON- be 
 mean to be together . that -PRON- have fight the good fight , side by side , in the past or in the future , -PRON- do not know . -PRON- be a rational man , but -PRON- have learn the value of a good companion , and from the moment -PRON- clap eye on -PRON- , -PRON- know -PRON- trust -PRON- as well as -PRON- do -PRON- . yes . -PRON- want -PRON- with -PRON- . " 
 -PRON- blush , or say something meaningless . for the first time since Afghanistan , -PRON- feel that -PRON- have worth in the world .

VON F. COMPANY , 1B C HEAP STREET , LONDON . 
 -PRON- be a cheap room house in Shoreditch . there be a policeman at the front door . Lestrade greet -PRON- by name and make to usher -PRON- in , and -PRON- be ready to enter , but -PRON- friend squat on the doorstep , and pull a magnify glass from -PRON- coat pocket . -PRON- examine the mud on the wrought iron 
 boot - scraper , prod at -PRON- with -PRON- forefinger . only when -PRON- be satisfied would -PRON- let -PRON- go inside . 
 -PRON- walk upstairs . the room in which the crime have be commit be obvious : -PRON- be flank by two burly constable . 
 Lestrade nod to the man , and -PRON- stand aside . -PRON- walk in . 
 -PRON- be not , as -PRON- say , a writer by profession , and -PRON- hesitate to describe that place , know that -PRON- word can not do -PRON- justice . still , -PRON- have begin this narrative , and -PRON- fear -PRON- must continue . a murder have be commit in that little bedsit . the body , what be leave of -PRON- , be still there , on the floor . -PRON- see -PRON- , but , at first , somehow , -PRON- do not see -PRON- . what -PRON- see instead be what have spray and gush from the throat and chest of the victim : in color -PRON- range from bile - green to grass - green . -PRON- have soak into the threadbare carpet and spatter the wallpaper . -PRON- imagine -PRON- for one moment the work of some hellish artist who have decide to create a study in emerald . 
 after what seem like a hundred year -PRON- look down at the body , open like a rabbit on a butcher ’s slab , and try to make sense of what -PRON- see . -PRON- remove -PRON- hat , and -PRON- friend do the same . 
 -PRON- kneel and inspect the body , examine the cut and gash . then -PRON- pull out -PRON- magnify glass , and walk over to the wall , examine the gout of dry ichor . 
 " -PRON- have already do that , " say Inspector Lestrade . 
 " indeed ? " say -PRON- friend . " what do -PRON- make of this , then ? -PRON- do believe -PRON- be a word . " 
 Lestrade walk to the place -PRON- friend be stand , and look up . there be a word , write in capital , in green blood , on the fade yellow wallpaper , some little way above Lestrade ’s head . 
 " R - a - C - h - e … ? " say Lestrade , spell -PRON- out . " obviously -PRON- be go to write ' Rachel , ' but -PRON- be interrupt . so — -PRON- must look for a woman … . " 
 -PRON- friend say nothing . -PRON- walk back to the corpse and pick up -PRON- hand , one after the other . the fingertip be clean of ichor . " -PRON- think -PRON- have establish that the word be not write by -PRON- Royal Highness — " 
 " what the Devil make -PRON- say — ? " 
 " -PRON- dear Lestrade . please give -PRON- some credit for have a brain . the corpse be obviously not that of a man — the color of -PRON- blood , the number of limb , the eye , the position of the face , all these thing bespeak the blood royal . while -PRON- can not say which royal line , -PRON- would hazard that -PRON- be an heir , perhaps … no , second in line to the throne … in one of the german principality . " 
 " that be amazing . " Lestrade hesitate , then -PRON- say , " this be Prince Franz Drago of Bohemia . -PRON- be here in Albion as a guest of -PRON- Majesty Victoria . here for a holiday and a change of air … . " 
 " for the theater , the whore , and the gaming table , -PRON- mean . " 
 " if -PRON- say so . " Lestrade look put out . " anyway , -PRON- have give -PRON- a fine lead with this Rachel woman . although -PRON- do not doubt -PRON- would have find -PRON- on -PRON- own . " 
 " Doubtless , " say -PRON- friend . 
 -PRON- inspect the room further , comment acidly several time that the police , with -PRON- boot , have obscure footprint and move thing that may have be of use to anyone attempt to reconstruct the event of the previous night . 
 still , -PRON- seem interested in a small patch of mud -PRON- find behind the door . beside the fireplace -PRON- find what appear to be some ash or dirt . 
 " do -PRON- see this ? " -PRON- ask Lestrade . 
 " -PRON- Majesty ’s police , " reply Lestrade , " tend not to be excite by ash in a fireplace . -PRON- ’ where ash tend to be find . " and -PRON- chuckle at that . 
 -PRON- friend take a pinch of the ash and rub -PRON- between -PRON- finger , then sniff the remain . finally , -PRON- scoop up what be leave of the material and tip -PRON- into a glass vial , which -PRON- stopper and place in an inner pocket of -PRON- coat . 
 -PRON- stand up . " and the body ? " 
 Lestrade say , " the palace will send -PRON- own people . " 
 -PRON- friend nod at -PRON- , and together -PRON- walk to the door . -PRON- friend sigh . " Inspector . -PRON- quest for Miss Rachel may prove fruitless . among other thing , Rache be a german word . -PRON- mean " revenge . " check -PRON- dictionary . there be other meaning . " 
 -PRON- reach the bottom of the stair and walk out onto the street . " -PRON- have never see royalty before this morning , have -PRON- ? " -PRON- ask . -PRON- shake -PRON- head . " well , the sight can be unnerve , if -PRON- be unprepared . why -PRON- good fellow — -PRON- be tremble ! " 
 " forgive -PRON- . -PRON- shall be fine in moment . " 
 " Would -PRON- do -PRON- good to walk ? " -PRON- ask , and -PRON- assent , certain that if -PRON- do not walk then -PRON- would begin to scream . 
 " West , then , " say -PRON- friend , point to the dark tower of the palace . and -PRON- commence to walk . 
 " so , " say -PRON- friend , after some time . " -PRON- have never have any personal encounter with any of the crown head of Europe ? " 
 " no , " -PRON- say . 
 " -PRON- believe -PRON- can confidently state that -PRON- shall , " -PRON- tell -PRON- . " and not with a corpse this time . very soon . " 
 " -PRON- dear fellow , whatever make -PRON- believe — ? " 
 in reply -PRON- point to a carriage , black - paint , that have pull up fifty yard ahead of -PRON- . a man in a black top hat and a greatcoat stand by the door , hold -PRON- open , wait , silently . a coat of arm familiar to every child in Albion be paint in gold upon the carriage door . 
 " there be invitation one do not refuse , " say -PRON- friend . -PRON- doff -PRON- own hat to the footman , and -PRON- do believe that -PRON- be smile as -PRON- climb into the boxlike space and relax back into the soft , leathery cushion . 
 when -PRON- attempt to speak with -PRON- during the journey to the palace , -PRON- place -PRON- finger over -PRON- lip . then -PRON- close -PRON- eye and seem sink deep in thought . -PRON- , for -PRON- part , try to remember what -PRON- know of german royalty , but , apart from the Queen ’s consort , Prince Albert , be german , -PRON- know little enough . 
 -PRON- put a hand in -PRON- pocket , pull out a handful of coin — brown and silver , black and copper - green . -PRON- stare at the portrait stamp on each of -PRON- of -PRON- Queen , and feel both patriotic pride and stark dread . -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have once be a military man and a stranger to fear , and -PRON- could remember when this have be the plain truth . for a moment -PRON- remember a time when -PRON- have be a crack - shot — even , -PRON- like to think , something of a marksman — but -PRON- right hand shake as if -PRON- be palsy , and the coin jingle and chink , and -PRON- feel only regret .

( AVAILABLE in v ANILLA and ORIGINAL MENTHOLATUM FORMULATIONS . ) 
 the Queen ’s consort , Prince Albert , be a big man with an impressive handlebar mustache and a recede hairline , and -PRON- be undeniably and entirely human . -PRON- meet -PRON- in the corridor , nod to -PRON- friend and to -PRON- , do not ask -PRON- for -PRON- name or offer to shake hand . 
 " the Queen be most upset , " -PRON- say . -PRON- have an accent . -PRON- pronounce -PRON- Ss as Zs : Mozt . Upzet . " Franz be one of -PRON- favorite . -PRON- have so many nephew . but -PRON- make -PRON- laugh so . -PRON- will find the one who do this to -PRON- . " 
 " -PRON- will do -PRON- good , " say -PRON- friend . 
 " -PRON- have read -PRON- monograph , " say Prince Albert . " -PRON- be -PRON- who tell -PRON- that -PRON- should be consult . -PRON- hope -PRON- do right . " 
 " as do -PRON- , " say -PRON- friend . 
 and then the great door be open , and -PRON- be usher into the darkness and the presence of the Queen . 
 -PRON- be call Victoria , because -PRON- have beat -PRON- in battle , seven hundred year before , and -PRON- be call Gloriana , because -PRON- be glorious , and -PRON- be call the Queen , because the human mouth be not shape to say -PRON- true name . -PRON- be huge , huge than -PRON- have imagine possible , and -PRON- squat in the shadow stare down at -PRON- , without move . 
 Thizsz muzzst be zsolve . the word come from the shadow . " indeed , madam , " say -PRON- friend . 
 a limb squirm and point at -PRON- . Zstepp forward . 
 -PRON- want to walk . -PRON- leg would not move . 
 -PRON- friend come to -PRON- rescue then . -PRON- take -PRON- by the elbow and walk -PRON- toward -PRON- Majesty . 
 Isz not to be afraid . isz to be worthy . isz to be a companion . that be what -PRON- say to -PRON- . -PRON- voice be a very sweet contralto , with a distant buzz . then the limb uncoiled and extended , and -PRON- touch -PRON- shoulder . there be a moment , but only a moment , of a pain deep and more profound than anything -PRON- have ever experience , and then -PRON- be replace by a pervasive sense of well - being . -PRON- could feel the muscle in -PRON- shoulder relax , and , for the first time since Afghanistan , -PRON- be free from pain . 
 then -PRON- friend walk forward . Victoria speak to -PRON- , yet -PRON- could not hear -PRON- word ; -PRON- wonder if -PRON- go , somehow , directly from -PRON- mind to -PRON- , if this be the Queen ’s Counsel -PRON- have read about in the history . -PRON- reply aloud . 
 " certainly , madam . -PRON- can tell -PRON- that there be two other man with -PRON- nephew in that room in Shoreditch , that night . the footprint be , although obscure , unmistakable . " and then , " yes . -PRON- understand … . -PRON- believe so … . yes . " 
 -PRON- be quiet when -PRON- leave the palace , and say nothing to -PRON- as -PRON- ride back to Baker Street . -PRON- be dark already . -PRON- wonder how long -PRON- have spend in the palace . 
 Fingers of sooty fog twine across the road and the sky . 
 upon -PRON- return to Baker Street , in the looking - glass of -PRON- room , -PRON- observe that the frog - white skin across -PRON- shoulder have take on a pinkish tinge . -PRON- hope that -PRON- be not imagine -PRON- , that -PRON- be not merely the moonlight through the window .

 ) ROMANIA , PARIS , LONDON , WHITBY . YOU’VE try the rest — now try the BEST ! ! 
 that -PRON- friend be a master of disguise should have come as no surprise to -PRON- , yet surprise -PRON- -PRON- do . over the next ten day a strange assortment of character come in through -PRON- door in Baker Street — an elderly chinese man , a young roué , a fat , red - haired woman of whose former profession there could be little doubt , and a venerable old buffer , -PRON- foot swell and bandage from gout . each of -PRON- would walk into -PRON- friend ’s room , and , with a speed that would have do justice to a music - hall 
 " quick - change artist , " -PRON- friend would walk out . 
 -PRON- would not talk about what -PRON- have be do on these occasion , prefer to relax , stare off into space , occasionally make notation on any scrap of paper to hand , notation -PRON- find , frankly , incomprehensible . -PRON- seem entirely preoccupied , so much so that -PRON- find -PRON- worry about -PRON- well - being . and then , late one afternoon , -PRON- come home dress in -PRON- own clothe , with an easy grin upon -PRON- face , and -PRON- ask if -PRON- be interested in the theater . 
 " as much as the next man , " -PRON- tell -PRON- . 
 " then fetch -PRON- opera glass , " -PRON- tell -PRON- . " -PRON- be off to Drury Lane . " 
 -PRON- have expect a light opera , or something of the kind , but instead -PRON- find -PRON- in what must have be the bad theater in Drury Lane , for all that -PRON- have name -PRON- after the royal court — and to be honest , -PRON- be barely in Drury Lane at all , be situate at the Shaftesbury Avenue end of the road , where the avenue approach the rookery of St. Giles . on -PRON- friend ’s advice -PRON- conceal -PRON- wallet , and , follow -PRON- example , -PRON- carry a stout stick . 
 once -PRON- be seat in the stall ( -PRON- have buy a threepenny orange from one of the lovely young woman who sell -PRON- to the member of the audience , and -PRON- suck -PRON- as -PRON- wait ) , -PRON- friend say , quietly , " -PRON- should only count -PRON- lucky that -PRON- do not need to accompany -PRON- to the gambling den or the brothel . or the madhouse — another place that Prince Franz delight in visit , as -PRON- have learn . but there be nowhere -PRON- go to more than once . nowhere but — " 
 the orchestra strike up , and the curtain be raise . -PRON- friend be silent . 
 -PRON- be a fine enough show in -PRON- way : three one - act play be perform . comic song be sing between the act . the lead man be tall , languid , and have a fine singing voice ; the lead lady be elegant , and -PRON- voice carry through all the theater ; the comedian have a fine touch for patter song . 
 the first play be a broad comedy of mistaken identity : the lead man play a pair of identical twin who have never meet , but have manage , by a set of comical misadventure , each to find -PRON- engage to be married to the same young lady — who , amusingly , think -PRON- engage to only one man . door swing open and close as the actor change from identity to identity . 
 the second play be a heartbreaking tale of an orphan girl who starve in the snow sell hothouse violet — -PRON- grandmother recognize -PRON- at the last , and swear that -PRON- be the babe steal ten year back by bandit , but -PRON- be too late , and the frozen little angel breathe -PRON- last . -PRON- must confess -PRON- find -PRON- wipe -PRON- eye with -PRON- linen handkerchief more than once . 
 the performance finish with a rouse historical narrative : the entire company play the man and woman of a village on the shore of the ocean , seven hundred year before -PRON- modern time . -PRON- see shape rise from the sea , in the distance . the hero joyously proclaim to the villager that these be the Old Ones whose come be foretold , return to -PRON- from R’lyeh , and from dim Carcosa , and from the plain of Leng , where -PRON- have sleep , or wait , or pass out the time of -PRON- death . the comedian opine that the other villager have all be eat too many pie and drink too much ale , and -PRON- be imagine the shape . a portly gentleman play a priest of the Roman God tell the villager that the shape in the sea be monster and demon , and must be destroy . 
 at the climax , the hero beat the priest to death with -PRON- own crucifer , and prepare to welcome -PRON- as -PRON- come . the heroine sing a haunting aria , whilst , in an astonishing display of magic - lantern trickery , -PRON- seem as if -PRON- see -PRON- shadow cross the sky at the back of the stage : the Queen of Albion -PRON- , and the Black one of Egypt ( in shape almost like a man ) , follow by the Ancient Goat , Parent to a 
 Thousand , Emperor of all China , and the Czar Unanswerable , and -PRON- who preside over the New World , and the White Lady of the Antarctic Fastness , and the other . and as each shadow cross the stage , or appear to , from out of every throat in the gallery come , unbidden , a mighty " Huzzah ! " until the air -PRON- seem to vibrate . the moon rise in the paint sky , and then , at -PRON- height , in one final moment of theatrical magic , -PRON- turn from a pallid yellow , as -PRON- be in the old tale , to the comfort crimson of the moon that shine down upon -PRON- all today . 
 the member of the cast take -PRON- bow and -PRON- curtain call to cheer and laughter , and the curtain fall for the last time , and the show be do . 
 " there , " say -PRON- friend . " what do -PRON- think ? " 
 " Jolly , jolly good , " -PRON- tell -PRON- , -PRON- hand sore from applaud . " stout fellow , " -PRON- say , with a smile . " let -PRON- go backstage . " 
 -PRON- walk outside and into an alley beside the theater , to the stage door , where a thin woman with a wen on -PRON- cheek knit busily . -PRON- friend show -PRON- a visit card , and -PRON- direct -PRON- into the building and up some step to a small communal dressing room . 
 oil lamp and candle gutter in front of smear looking glass , and man and woman be take off -PRON- makeup and costume with no regard to the propriety of gender . -PRON- avert -PRON- eye . -PRON- friend seem unperturbed . " may -PRON- talk to Mr. Vernet ? " -PRON- ask , loudly . 
 a young woman who have play the heroine ’s good friend in the first play , and the saucy innkeeper ’s daughter in the last , point -PRON- to the end of the room . " sherry ! Sherry Vernet ! " -PRON- call . 
 the young man who stand up in response be lean ; less conventionally handsome than -PRON- have seem from the other side of the footlight . -PRON- peer at -PRON- quizzically . " -PRON- do not believe -PRON- have have the pleasure … ? " 
 " -PRON- name be Henry Camberley , " say -PRON- friend , drawl -PRON- speech somewhat . " -PRON- may have hear of -PRON- . " 
 " -PRON- must confess that -PRON- have not have that privilege , " say Vernet . -PRON- friend present the actor with an engrave card . 
 the man look at the card with unfeigned interest . " a theatrical promoter ? from the New World ? my , -PRON- . and this be … ? " -PRON- smile at -PRON- . 
 " this be a friend of -PRON- , Mister Sebastian . -PRON- be not of the profession . " 
 -PRON- mutter something about have enjoy the performance enormously , and shake hand with the actor . 
 -PRON- friend say , " have -PRON- ever visit the New World ? " 
 " -PRON- have not yet have that honor , " admit Vernet , " although -PRON- have always be -PRON- dear wish . " 
 " well , -PRON- good man , " say -PRON- friend , with the easy informality of a New Worlder . " maybe -PRON- will get -PRON- wish . that last play . -PRON- have never see anything like -PRON- . do -PRON- write -PRON- ? " 
 " alas , no . the playwright be a good friend of -PRON- . although -PRON- devise the mechanism of the magic - lantern shadow show . -PRON- will not see fine on the stage today . " 
 " Would -PRON- give -PRON- the playwright ’s name ? perhaps -PRON- should speak to -PRON- directly , this friend of -PRON- . " 
 Vernet shake -PRON- head . " that will not be possible , -PRON- be afraid . -PRON- be a professional man , and do not wish -PRON- connection with the stage publicly to be know . " 
 " -PRON- see . " -PRON- friend pull a pipe from -PRON- pocket and put -PRON- in -PRON- mouth . then -PRON- pat -PRON- pocket . " -PRON- be sorry , " -PRON- begin . " -PRON- have forget to bring -PRON- tobacco pouch . " 
 " -PRON- smoke a strong black shag , " say the actor , " but if -PRON- have no objection — " 
 " none ! " say -PRON- friend , heartily . " why , -PRON- smoke a strong shag -PRON- , " and -PRON- fill -PRON- pipe with the actor ’s tobacco , and the two man puff away , while -PRON- friend describe a vision -PRON- have for a play that could tour the city of the New World , from Manhattan Island all the way to the furth tip of the continent in the distant south . the first act would be the last play -PRON- have see . the rest of the play may perhaps tell of the dominion of the Old Ones over humanity and -PRON- god , perhaps tell what may have happen if people have have no Royal Families to look up to — a world of barbarism and darkness—“But -PRON- mysterious professional man would be the play ’s author , and what occur would be -PRON- alone to decide , " interject -PRON- friend . " -PRON- drama would be -PRON- . but -PRON- can guarantee -PRON- audience beyond -PRON- imagining , and a significant share of the taking at the door . let -PRON- say fifty percent ! " 
 " this be most exciting , " say Vernet . " -PRON- hope -PRON- will not turn out to have be a pipe - dream ! " 
 " no sir , -PRON- shall not ! " say -PRON- friend , puff on -PRON- own pipe , chuckle at the man ’s joke . " come to -PRON- room in Baker Street tomorrow morning , after breakfast - time , say at ten , in company with -PRON- author friend , and -PRON- shall have the contract draw up and wait . " 
 with that the actor clamber up onto -PRON- chair and clap -PRON- hand for silence . " lady and gentleman of the company , -PRON- have an announcement to make , " -PRON- say , -PRON- resonant voice fill the room . " this gentleman be Henry Camberley , the theatrical promoter , and -PRON- be propose to take -PRON- across the Atlantic Ocean , and on to fame and fortune . " 
 there be several cheer , and the comedian say , " well , -PRON- will make a change from herring and pickle - cabbage , " and the company laugh . 
 and -PRON- be to the smile of all of -PRON- that -PRON- walk out of the theater and onto the fog - wreathed street . 
 " -PRON- dear fellow , " -PRON- say . " whatever be — " 
 " not another word , " say -PRON- friend . " there be many ear in the city . " 
 and not another word be speak until -PRON- have hail a cab , and clamber inside , and be rattle up the Charing Cross Road . 
 and even then , before -PRON- say anything , -PRON- friend take -PRON- pipe from -PRON- mouth , and empty the half - smoke content of the bowl into a small tin . -PRON- press the lid onto the tin , and place -PRON- in -PRON- pocket . 
 " there , " -PRON- say . " that ’ the Tall Man find , or -PRON- be a dutchman . now , -PRON- just have to hope that the cupidity and the curiosity of the Limping Doctor prove enough to bring -PRON- to -PRON- tomorrow morning . " 
 " the Limping Doctor ? " 
 -PRON- friend snort . " that be what -PRON- have be call -PRON- . -PRON- be obvious , from footprint and much else 
 besides , when -PRON- see the prince ’s body , that two man have be in that room that night : a tall man , who , unless -PRON- miss -PRON- guess , -PRON- have just encounter , and a small man with a limp , who eviscerate the prince with a professional skill that betray the medical man . " 
 " a doctor ? " 
 " indeed . -PRON- hate to say this , but -PRON- be -PRON- experience that when a doctor go to the bad , -PRON- be a fouler and dark creature than the bad cut - throat . there be Huston , the acid - bath man , and Campbell , who bring the procrustean bed to Ealing … " and -PRON- carry on in a similar vein for the rest of -PRON- journey . 
 the cab pull up beside the curb . " that will be one and tenpence , " say the cabbie . -PRON- friend toss -PRON- a florin , which -PRON- catch and tip to -PRON- ragged tall hat . " much oblige to -PRON- both , " -PRON- call out , as the horse clop into the fog . 
 -PRON- walk to -PRON- front door . as -PRON- unlock -PRON- , -PRON- friend say , " Odd . -PRON- cabbie just ignore that fellow on the corner . " 
 " -PRON- do that at the end of a shift , " -PRON- point out . " indeed -PRON- do , " say -PRON- friend . 
 -PRON- dream of shadow that night , vast shadow that blot out the sun , and -PRON- call out to -PRON- in -PRON- desperation , but -PRON- do not listen .

 Inspector Lestrade be the first to arrive . 
 " -PRON- have post -PRON- man in the street ? " ask -PRON- friend . 
 " -PRON- have , " say Lestrade . " with strict order to let anyone in who come , but to arrest anyone try to leave . " 
 " and -PRON- have handcuff with -PRON- ? " 
 in reply , Lestrade put -PRON- hand in -PRON- pocket , and jangle two pair of cuff , grimly . " now sir , " -PRON- say . " while -PRON- wait , why do -PRON- not tell -PRON- what -PRON- be wait for ? " 
 -PRON- friend pull -PRON- pipe out of -PRON- pocket . -PRON- do not put -PRON- in -PRON- mouth , but place -PRON- on the table in front of -PRON- . then -PRON- take the tin from the night before , and a glass vial -PRON- recognize as the one -PRON- have have in the room in Shoreditch . 
 " there , " -PRON- say . " the coffin - nail , as -PRON- trust -PRON- shall prove , for -PRON- Master Vernet . " -PRON- pause . then -PRON- take out -PRON- pocket watch , lay -PRON- carefully on the table . " -PRON- have several minute before -PRON- arrive . " -PRON- turn to -PRON- . " what do -PRON- know of the restorationist ? " 
 " not a bless thing , " -PRON- tell -PRON- . 
 Lestrade coughed . " if -PRON- be talk about what -PRON- think -PRON- be talk about , " -PRON- say , " perhaps -PRON- should leave -PRON- there . enough ’ enough . " 
 " too late for that , " say -PRON- friend . " for there be those who do not believe that the coming of the Old Ones be the fine thing -PRON- all know -PRON- to be . anarchist to a man , -PRON- would see the old way restore — mankind in control of -PRON- own destiny , if -PRON- will . " 
 " -PRON- will not hear this sedition speak , " say Lestrade . " -PRON- must warn -PRON- — " 
 " -PRON- must warn -PRON- not to be such a fathead , " say -PRON- friend . " because -PRON- be the restorationist that kill Prince Franz Drago . -PRON- murder , -PRON- kill , in a vain effort to force -PRON- master to leave -PRON- alone in the darkness . the Prince be kill by a rache — -PRON- ’ an old term for a hunting dog , Inspector , as -PRON- would know if -PRON- have look in a dictionary . -PRON- also mean " revenge . " and the hunter leave -PRON- signature on the wallpaper in the murder room , just as an artist may sign a canvas . but -PRON- be not the one who kill the Prince . " 
 " the Limping Doctor ! " -PRON- exclaim . 
 " very good . there be a tall man there that night — -PRON- could tell -PRON- height , for the word be write at eye level . -PRON- smoke a pipe — the ash and dottle sat unburnt in the fireplace , and -PRON- have tap out -PRON- pipe with ease on the mantel , something a small man would not have do . the tobacco be an unusual blend of shag . the footprint in the room have , for the most part , be almost obliterate by -PRON- man , but there be several clear print behind the door and by the window . someone have wait there : a small man from -PRON- stride , who put -PRON- weight on -PRON- right leg . on the path outside -PRON- have several clear print , and the different color of clay on the bootscraper give -PRON- more information : a tall man , who have accompany the Prince into those room , and have , later , walk out . wait for -PRON- to arrive be the man who have slice up the Prince so impressively … . " 
 Lestrade make an uncomfortable noise that do not quite become a word . 
 " -PRON- have spend many day retrace the movement of -PRON- Highness . -PRON- go from gamble hell to brothel to dining den to madhouse look for -PRON- pipe - smoking man and -PRON- friend . -PRON- make no progress until -PRON- think to check the newspaper of Bohemia , search for a clue to the Prince ’s recent activity there , and in -PRON- -PRON- learn that an English Theatrical Troupe have be in Prague last month , and have perform before Prince Franz Drago … . " 
 " Good Lord , " -PRON- say . " so that Sherry Vernet fellow — " " be a restorationist . exactly . " 
 -PRON- be shake -PRON- head in wonder at -PRON- friend ’s intelligence and skill of observation , when there be a knock on the door . 
 " this will be -PRON- quarry ! " say -PRON- friend . " careful now ! " 
 Lestrade put -PRON- hand deep into -PRON- pocket , where -PRON- have no doubt -PRON- keep a pistol . -PRON- swallow , nervously . 
 -PRON- friend call out , " please , come in ! " the door open . 
 -PRON- be not Vernet , nor be -PRON- a Limping Doctor . -PRON- be one of the young street Arabs who earn a crust run errands—“in the employ of Messrs. Street and Walker , " as -PRON- use to say when -PRON- be young . 
 " please sir , " -PRON- say . " be there a Mister Henry Camberley here ? -PRON- be ask by a gentleman to deliver a note . " 
 " -PRON- be -PRON- , " say -PRON- friend . " and for a sixpence , what can -PRON- tell -PRON- about the gentleman who give -PRON- the note ? " 
 the young lad , who volunteer that -PRON- name be Wiggins , bite the sixpence before make -PRON- vanish , then tell -PRON- that the cheery cove who give -PRON- the note be on the tall side , with dark hair , and , -PRON- add , -PRON- have be smoke a pipe . 
 -PRON- have the note here , and take the liberty of transcribe -PRON- . 
 -PRON- dear Sir , 
 -PRON- do not address -PRON- as Henry Camberley , for -PRON- be a name to which -PRON- have no claim . -PRON- be surprised that -PRON- do not announce -PRON- under -PRON- own name , for -PRON- be a fine one , and one that do -PRON- credit . -PRON- have read a number of -PRON- paper , when -PRON- have be able to obtain -PRON- . indeed , -PRON- correspond with -PRON- quite profitably two year ago about certain theoretical anomaly in -PRON- paper on the Dynamics of an Asteroid . 
 -PRON- be amuse to meet -PRON- , yesterday evening . a few tip which may save -PRON- bother in time to come , in the profession -PRON- currently follow . firstly , a pipe - smoking man may possibly have a brand - new , unused pipe in -PRON- pocket , and no tobacco , but -PRON- be exceedingly unlikely — at least as unlikely as a theatrical promoter with no idea of the usual custom of recompense on a tour , who be accompany by a taciturn ex - army officer ( Afghanistan , unless -PRON- miss -PRON- guess ) . incidentally , while -PRON- be correct that the street of London have ear , -PRON- may also behoove -PRON- in future not to take the first cab that come along . cab driver have ear too , if -PRON- choose to use -PRON- . 
 -PRON- be certainly correct in one of -PRON- supposition : -PRON- be indeed -PRON- who lure the half - blood creature back to the room in Shoreditch . 
 if -PRON- be any comfort to -PRON- , have learn a little of -PRON- recreational predilection , -PRON- have tell -PRON- -PRON- have procure for -PRON- a girl , abduct from a convent in Cornwall where -PRON- have never see a man , and that -PRON- would only take -PRON- touch , and the sight of -PRON- face , to tip -PRON- over into a perfect madness . 
 have -PRON- exist , -PRON- would have feast on -PRON- madness while -PRON- take -PRON- , like a man suck the flesh from a ripe peach leave nothing behind but the skin and the pit . -PRON- have see -PRON- do this . -PRON- have see -PRON- do far bad . and -PRON- be not the price -PRON- pay for peace and prosperity . -PRON- be too great a price for that . 
 the good doctor — who believe as -PRON- do , and who do indeed write -PRON- little performance , for -PRON- have some crowd - pleasing skill — be wait for -PRON- , with -PRON- knife . 
 -PRON- send this note , not as a catch - -PRON- - if - -PRON- - can taunt , for -PRON- be go , the estimable doctor and -PRON- , and -PRON- shall not find -PRON- , but to tell -PRON- that -PRON- be good to feel that , if only for a moment , -PRON- have a worthy adversary . Worthier by far than inhuman creature from beyond the Pit . 
 -PRON- fear the Strand Players will need to find -PRON- a new leading man . 
 -PRON- will not sign -PRON- Vernet , and until the hunt be do and the world restore , -PRON- beg -PRON- to think of -PRON- simply as , 

 Rache . 
 Inspector Lestrade run from the room , call to -PRON- man . -PRON- make young Wiggins take -PRON- to the place where the man have give -PRON- the note , for all the world as if Vernet the actor would be wait there for -PRON- , a - smoking of -PRON- pipe . from the window -PRON- watch -PRON- run , -PRON- friend and -PRON- , and -PRON- shake -PRON- head . 
 " -PRON- will stop and search all the train leave London , all the ship leave Albion for Europe or the New World , " say -PRON- friend , " look for a tall man , and -PRON- companion , a small , thickset medical man , with a slight limp . -PRON- will close the port . every way out of the country will be block . " 
 " do -PRON- think -PRON- will catch -PRON- , then ? " 
 -PRON- friend shake -PRON- head . " -PRON- may be wrong , " -PRON- say , " but -PRON- would wager that -PRON- and -PRON- friend be even now only a mile or so away , in the rookery of St. Giles , where the police will not go except by the dozen . and -PRON- will hide up there until the hue and cry have die away . and then -PRON- will be about -PRON- business . " 
 " what make -PRON- say that ? " 
 " because , " say -PRON- friend , " if -PRON- position be reverse , -PRON- be what -PRON- would do . -PRON- should burn the note , by the way . " 
 -PRON- frown . " but surely -PRON- ’ evidence , " -PRON- say . " -PRON- ’ seditionary nonsense , " say -PRON- friend . 
 and -PRON- should have burn -PRON- . indeed , -PRON- tell Lestrade -PRON- have burn -PRON- , when -PRON- return , and -PRON- congratulate -PRON- on -PRON- good sense . Lestrade keep -PRON- job , and Prince Albert write a note to -PRON- friend congratulate -PRON- on -PRON- deduction , while regret that the perpetrator be still at large . 
 -PRON- have not yet catch Sherry Vernet , or whatever -PRON- name really be , nor be any trace find of -PRON- murderous accomplice , tentatively identify as a former military surgeon name John ( or perhaps James ) Watson . curiously , -PRON- be reveal that -PRON- have also be in Afghanistan . -PRON- wonder if -PRON- ever meet . 
 -PRON- shoulder , touch by the Queen , continue to improve , the flesh fill and -PRON- heal . soon -PRON- shall be a dead - shot once more . 
 one night when -PRON- be alone , several month ago , -PRON- ask -PRON- friend if -PRON- remember the correspondence refer to in the letter from the man who sign -PRON- Rache . -PRON- friend say that -PRON- remember -PRON- well , and that " Sigerson " ( for so the actor have call -PRON- then , claim to be an Icelander ) have be inspire by an equation of -PRON- friend ’s to suggest some wild theory further the relationship between mass , energy , and the hypothetical speed of light . " nonsense , of course , " say -PRON- friend , without smile . " but inspired and dangerous nonsense nonetheless . " 
 the palace eventually send word that the Queen be pleased with -PRON- friend ’s accomplishment in the case , and there the matter have rest . 
 -PRON- doubt -PRON- friend will leave -PRON- alone , though ; -PRON- will not be over until one of -PRON- have kill the other . 
 -PRON- keep the note . -PRON- have say thing in this retelling of event that be not to be say . if -PRON- be a sensible man -PRON- would burn all these page , but then , as -PRON- friend teach -PRON- , even ashe can give up -PRON- secret . 
 instead , -PRON- shall place these paper in a strongbox at -PRON- bank with instruction that the box may not be open until long after anyone now live be dead . although , in the light of the recent event in Russia , -PRON- fear that day may be close than any of -PRON- would care to think .
